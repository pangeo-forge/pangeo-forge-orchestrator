@dataclass
class MultipleModels:
    """For any given API endpoint, a distinct Python object is required to manage each of type of
    interaction that a user has with the database. Typically, these interaction types will be one
    of the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. Rather than writing a distinct class
    for each of these four interaction types, ``SQLModel``'s multiple models with inheritance
    (https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/fastapi/multiple-models/#multiple-models-with-inheritance)
    design pattern allows us to use Python class inheritance to avoid repetition. In this style,
    we define a base model from which all other models can be deterministically derived. This
    class, ``MultipleModels``, provides a container for generating and holding a grouping of these
    objects, and is used to implement ``SQLModel``'s multiple models with inheritance design pattern
    more reliably and with less code repetition than is currently supported by ``SQLModel`` alone.

    :param path: The relative path (a.k.a. route or endpoint) of the API which the objects contained
      in this class will be used to interact with. For example, ``"/my_database_table/"``.
    :param base: The base model. This object must inherit from ``sqlmodel.SQLModel`` and contain
      type-annotated fields for each of the columns in the database table. Its name must be of
      the format ``<TableName>Base``.
    :param response: The response class. This object inherits from the base model and defines just
      one additional required field, ``id``, with type ``int``. Its name must be of the format
      ``<TableName>Read``. Note that while this object can theoretically be deterministically
      generated from the base model, in practical terms it is difficult to succinctly generate with
      either Python's built-in ``type()`` or ``types.new_class()`` function, therefore the most
      robust option is simply for the user to define and pass it to ``MultipleModels`` manually.
      (Note also that "id" as used here is just another way of saying "primary key".)
    :param extended_response: An optional response class for returning nested data from related
      tables in responses to ``read_single`` GET requests. For more information, refer to:
      https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/fastapi/relationships/#models-with-relationships.
