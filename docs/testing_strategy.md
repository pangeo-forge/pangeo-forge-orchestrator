# Testing strategy

The current testing strategy relies on [two local http servers](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/blob/620989215c8d191d55c3080d403d6454a895230b/tests/conftest.py#L215-L254) started during each test session, one representing a Bakery storage target, and one for serving data (e.g., `meta.yaml`s) which are hosted on GitHub in the production setting. As opposed to the server config used in `pangeo-forge-recipes` testing, the `pangeo-forge-orchestrator` server offers an un-authenticated GET method with an [authenticated POST method](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-forge-orchestrator/blob/620989215c8d191d55c3080d403d6454a895230b/tests/http_auth_server.py#L28-L55). This allows us to test, e.g., authenticating `fsspec` class instances with kwargs derived from `meta_types.bakery.StorageOptions`.
