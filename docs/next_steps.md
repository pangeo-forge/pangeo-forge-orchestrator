# Next steps

- Circle back to Orchestrator and BuildLogs ADR proposals
- Bring the official Bakery database within spec, as described in the {doc}`use_guide`
- Update the `catalog` CLI (and related pydantic types) to make it possible to build STAC Items for datasets built from un-merged Feedstocks
- Begin to merge automation repositories (i.e. unmerged portions of `pangeo-forge-prefect`) and refactor related GitHub Actions accordingly
